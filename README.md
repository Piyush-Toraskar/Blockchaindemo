# Blockchain Demo in Python

This project is a **simple blockchain simulation** implemented in Python and demonstrated in Google Colab. It simulates a small banking system with multiple users, transactions, and blocks. The project also includes **tampering detection and visualization**.

---

## Features

- Create **multiple blocks** with multiple transactions per block.
- Each block stores:
  - Previous hash
  - Current hash
  - Timestamp
  - Transactions
- **Verify blockchain integrity** before and after tampering.
- **Tampering demo**: Update a transaction to show how the blockchain detects inconsistencies.
- **Visual table display** of the blockchain using Pandas.
- Highlight tampered blocks in red for clear visualization.
